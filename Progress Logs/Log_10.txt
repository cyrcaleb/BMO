#Project Log Day 10  7/20/2022

It is currently the same day as the last project log but I got so much done today that I felt this portion deserved its own section.

After recieving the adapter for the driver board.  I was able to easily assemble the LCD screen, connect it to my pc, and use the power bank to power the driver board.

Initially I tried to run the files I had edited down but they were not the correct size, and did not fit the dimensions perfectly.  I had thought the resolution of the 
screen would be 800 by 600.  But I was wrong.

The actual resolution was 1024 by 768.  This meant that I had to go back, re-record the idle and active voice line animation, all with a newly resized character.

This, which is starting to become a theme around here, took very long.

But after resizing the videos and editing the clips to size.  They played perfectly and filled up the entire screen as intended.

I really feel like I got about 20 percent of the project done in about one day which feels great.  Tomorrow I plan to work on adding the mp4 files into the program so that they play when needed.

After that I can start dealing with the servos and speakers!  But if I wanted a desktop version of BMO, which I might switch to for conveniance, I would really just have
to paint BMO and start assembly.
