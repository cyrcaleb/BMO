#Project Log Day 14  8/30/2022

Came back from my trip and the parts I ordered finally came in.  I think at this point I am done with parts.

First part of assembly was to put in the metal inserts for the screws which was actually quite difficult.  I didnt have a soldering pen so I instead used a hammer which
made it difficult to reach certain positions.

Next, I put in the screen and gorilla glued the driver board to the back along with some styrofoam so it would actually stick.

Next I put in the front panel printed circuit boards.  They are currently setup so that they do take input and it goes directly to raspberri pi.  However since the screen
is runnign from my pc they currently have no use.  In the future I might try to run everything on the pi and perhaps put an 8-bit game on BMO.  But only if it can handle 
it.

After installing the pi I installed the servos.  These were pretty straight forward however at this current moment the arms keep falling off so I am going to have to 
gorilla glue them on.  

Then I installed the speakers which do connect to the raspberry pi.  Once again I tested them and they are functional. But since I want BMO to be apart of the PC they are
not in use.  

Lastly I installed the raspberri pi with the pi hat on top and connected all the wires from the speakers, servos, and front panel pcb's to it.
