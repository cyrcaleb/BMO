I am starting this log just a few hours after the creation of the first one.  I feel like I made some great progress and added a bunch of features such as allowing the 
user to play youtube videos, do a general search, grab information off of wikipedia all through voice activated commands.  

The program runs infinetly which is good for 
now because I technically need it to be always listening, much like a normal google home.  

The next time I edit this log will probably be when I do the voice cloning part which sounds particularly hard yet somehow equally interesting so I will see where that 
takes me.  

The only thing I am particularly worried about right now besides actually building everything with the hardware, which sounds very scary, is being able to transfer everyhting smoothly over to the raspberry pi.  Baby steps :)
