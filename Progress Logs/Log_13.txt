#Project Log Day 13  8/12/2022

Had to wait for my expansion board for the pi to come in so it has been a little over a week since the last log.  

I have made some great progress. I have completely finished the spray painting and varnish for BMO's parts.  I ended up changin the color of the button so it was more 
color accurate to the original and fixing the side decals so that they were more clean.

Unfortunately, I am still waiting on some of the front panel PCB's (printed circuit boards) for BMO.  But I did recieve the pca9685 i2c chip, which is an expansion board 
that goes directly on top of the pi.  It allows me to control multiple servos, connect the pi to the speakers, and connect a mic to the pi.

Today I managed to setup the servos to the pi/expansion board, and create a program to automatically move the servos on bootup!

Once again I am extremely happy with the result and just need to wait for more parts so I can finish the project.
