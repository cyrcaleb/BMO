#Project Log Day 4

The 3D printed parts have arrived.  From what I have seen the voice recognition software will not be able to work mainly because today's voice cloning software is 
focussed around making voices sound human.

The BMO voice is somewhat human but it has a pretty heavy accent and a lot of filters so the raw test audio is never clean enough to get the results needed.

You can see the testing audio and cloned audio example in the Voice Cloning Folder to see exactly what I am talking about.

Because of this I have decided to drop the voice cloning idea and go with a much simpler alternative.  Voice cloning was fun and I am glad I got it to work to some 
degree.  Perhaps I will be able to use it in the future.

Instead I have gone with the idea of just using BMO's Voice for simple commands with generic lines such as saying "Now playing your video".

To do this I have decided to find voice actor on Fiver to read out some scripted lines. 

So today I am script writing and finding the right artist.  I will also have to do some testing again to see if I can have visuals displayed the same time as audio is 
playing.
