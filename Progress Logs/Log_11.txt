#Project Log Day 11  7/24/2022

I've made some progress by adding two more animations into the mix and I have finally managed to add them all to the program.

I also managed to figure out a way to get the 46 second idle animation to run while taking in user inputs simultaneous.  This is something that took quite a bit as
the idle animation I had used prior was only about 4 seconds long so it did not have to constantly be taking user input while the file was running.

Some other functions I added was that if you ask BMO their favorite song, the actual song will be played.

I also made it so that if the user says stop or clear.  It will close chrome.

And finally I made it so that if the user says shutdown, the entire program will close.  

Im feeling a little burnt out and I have finals this week so most of my focus will be going towards that and also taking a little break. 

I need to start researching exactly what I need to get the speakers and servos to work along with what nails and inserts I need.

I might take a week off of this project just to research and focus on school work but I should be back and ready to make some serious progress and hopefully be able to 
get the spray painting done before I have to leave.
