#Project Log Day 12  8/2/2022

Been a little over a week since my last project log.

Since then I have ordered what should be the final circuit boards and components I need for this project.  The only other thing I might need is a soldering pen to put 
some metal inserts in.

As of today I have just finished painting BMO.  I had to buy primer, varnish and three different colors of paint for the body, arms, and legs.  I also used some of my 
sisters old acrylic paint to do the buttons. 

Im happy with all of them besides the green button.  I think I will go to the store and get a neon colored paint and redo the button because I think it is too close 
to the base color of BMO.

Besides the red, blue, yellow, and green button, I used black paint to do BMO's side decals.  After sifting through several fonts I landed on poppins font which was a
near perfect match.  I basically just printed it out, cut it out, and traced it to just finally paint over the area.  It wasn't perfect by any means but I've come to 
realize all the mistakes, or "happy little accidents", I've come across really just make BMO feel more personalized and give it character.  It feel more hand made.

After fixing the green button, the only things I can work on until then would be getting the program to run on the raspberry pi, figuring out servos, and figuring out 
speakers.  

After that I just have to install and i'd be done.
