#Project Log Day 7  7/18/2022

Today I got a lot done while simultaneous getting not that much done. 

I spent a huge amount of time researching, attempting, and failing to do one small but might task.

So essentially when BMO is IDLE, I would like to have a short 5 - 15 second idle animation where BMO occasional looks around or blinks and I wanted to have it so that
BMO would only start listening to you if you pressed one of the buttons on him.

I thought this would be a rather simple task but I couldn't have been more wrong.  I went through tons of documentaion about how to play an mp4 file and about the signal 
import to eventually get this thing to work.

It works exactly as intended by continuously playing the mp4 file, even when BMO starts listening to the user, and the lisenting process begins when the user presses
CONTROL + C in the terminal. I am a little worried about this as it means when I give BMO a button, it will have to press CONTROL + C at the same time and also do this
inside of the command terminal.

So just incase I have programmed a backup so that it runs continuously and listens every 5 or so seconds which is easily adjustable.

Once again, a small but necessary task was completed today.  It took extremely long but I am super super happy with how it came out and it feel so rewarding to have 
completed it, even if it took a while.
