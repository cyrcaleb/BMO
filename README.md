# BMO Project
The main goal of this project is to first create a program using python to essentially create a google home:
- I will need a raspberry pi to run the program
- A microphone to receive vocal input
- A speaker to send out vocal input
- The knowledge to actually create a program to do all these things effectively

I will also be putting this device inside a 3D Printed robot called BMO from adventure time:
- The robot will have seros to control the arms
- The robot BMO will also have a 8-inch LCD screen that will be able to present different BMO facial features and even be able to play little short snippets of video

Something I also want to add to this project is BMO's voice instead of the generic google output voice. In order to do this I will have to program voice cloning software and gather a library of BMO's voice to be analyze.

This is a huge project of mine that I am well aware will take a long time to complete as I do not have the knowledge about voice cloning, rasberry pi's, or 3d printing.  But this is something that I am extremely passionate about and cannot wait to learn about on my own.

Voice Cloning was super interesting and hopefully I will be able to implement it in further projects.  For more info as to why I had to drop it for now, see progress log #4 and the voice cloning folder.

### Hardware: ###

A picture of speakers, one of the servos, a raspberrry pi, and the 8 inch lcd screen that connects to the pi.  I put the pi in its case for now to reduce risk of damage.

### Active Animation: ###

Here I am using Adobe Character animation along with adobe photoshop to create my character.  The character copies eye movements I create and even the sounds I make
with my mouth.  See log #6 for more information.

### Audio Edit: ###

Using BandLab to edit the original BMO audio sent to me by the fiver artist.  See MP3 & MP4 Files folder for more on the audio.  See Progress Log #9 for more info on the process of creating the BMO animations using the audio.


### LCD Screen Success: ###

I was able to successfully setup the LCD screen and connect it to my pc.  From there I was able to play the all the BMO mp4 files that contained both the BMO face animations and the BMO voice lines!
