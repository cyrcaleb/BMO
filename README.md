# BMO Project
The main goal of this project is to first create a program using python to essentially create a google home:
- I will need a raspberry pi to run the program
- A microphone to receive vocal input
- A speaker to send out vocal input
- The knowledge to actually create a program to do all these things effectively

I will also be putting this device inside a 3D Printed robot called BMO from adventure time:
- The robot will have seros to control the arms
- The robot BMO will also have a 10-inch LCD screen that will be able to present different BMO facial features and even be able to play little short snippets of video

Something I also want to add to this project is BMO's voice instead of the generic google output voice. In order to do this I will have to program voice cloning software and gather a library of BMO's voice to be analyze.

This is a huge project of mine that I am well aware will take a long time to complete as I do not have the knowledge about voice cloning, rasberry pi's, or 3d printing.  But this is something that I am extremely passionate about and cannot wait to learn about on my own.
