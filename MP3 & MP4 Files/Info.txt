Here I have stored all the mp4 files created in adobe with character animation and photoshop.

They are each 800 by 600 format videos so they will fit perfectly to the smaller monitor.

I have an idle animation for BMO when he is not taking inputs from the user, I might add a second IDLE animation but I am unsure at the moment.

Additionally, I have the original BMO audio I received from the fiver voice artist, and the edited verison I have created from it.

For reference, I have included an example of what real BMO sounds like from the show.
