bmo-intro-adventure-time-distant-lands_rajGTddV.wav is the training audio for the voice clone.

bmo_clone.wav is the output line "Hello, my name is BMO" created through the training audio.

As you can see it is too far from the original voice to be used for my purposes.  Also voice cloning is very system intensive so even if I wanted to use this, it would not work with a raspberry pi.
